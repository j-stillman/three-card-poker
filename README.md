# three-card-poker

This project was built in March 2020 for CS 342 at UIC. It is an application to play Three Card Poker.

I see a lot of potential to improve this project, or at least use the concepts I learned from it. For various reasons this work suffered from a lack of planning, and that's unfortunate because I'm sure it would've benefitted from a firmer foundation.
